Server <----->  Client

Basically Rest API is a standard for communication between Server and Client.
- Works in Server, client Architecture.
- Always follow all HTTP methods [GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE].
- If we want to send anything using express JS it's very easy.
    a. res.send()  ---> Send any response.
    b. res.json() ---> Send JSON data.
    c. res.render() --> HTML Render it's a bit faster method, using this we can achive (SSR - Server Side Rendering)
